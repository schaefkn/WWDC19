 Hello World!

 Welcome to my playground! It is about something which I really care deeply about, besides computer science...
 Singing!

 Many people believe that they can't sing and never will able to be. They think that some people are born as good singers and others as bad ones. I believe that with enough time and effort everybody can learn to sing.

 So this is the reason I created this playground: To help *you* get started on your journey becoming a better and better singer. As with life itself the longer you practise the better and funnier it gets.

 What you will experience in this playground is a little and funny game. Your mission in order to win the game will be different in the two chapters. The game itself will be explained in detail later on.

 The important stuff in the beginning is what you see currently in the LiveView. It is the *Note Viewer*. It visualizes where your current tone is versus where the note you need to hit is. Your current tone is visualzed in *green*. While the note you need to hit is visualized in *red*. If both align the greener note will get a little bit bigger for you to clearly see. In the actual game the Note Viewer will be smaller.

 Now try the Noter Viewer out yourself by making different tones or simply speaking. What do you see ?
